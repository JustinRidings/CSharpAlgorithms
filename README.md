# CSharp Whiteboard
A collection of Design Patterns and Algorithms, implemented in C#.

### Prereqs

You will need .NET 8 Runtime/SDK in order to code / build / use as a dotnet tool.

- [Install .NET 8 SDK/Runtime Interactively](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0)

OR use CommandLine

- `winget install dotnet-runtime-8`
- `winget install dotnet-sdk-8`

### Project Layout

The [Patterns](https://github.com/JustinRidings/CSharpWhiteboard/tree/main/CSharpAlgorithms/Patterns) directory contains sub-directories for the different types of design patterns that exist, alogn with implementations. The [WhiteboardSolutions.cs](https://github.com/JustinRidings/CSharpWhiteboard/tree/main/CSharpAlgorithms/WhiteboardSolutions.cs) file contains static implementations for various whiteboarding questions. You can Demo each pattern or whiteboard solution by running the [Program](https://github.com/JustinRidings/CSharpWhiteboard/tree/main/CSharpAlgorithms/Program.cs) to see the output.
